        <p>The aim of this project is the development of a New TUIO Simulator for fast development and debugging of Multi-touch Applications.TUIO is a versatile protocol, designed specifically to meet the requirements of table-top tangible user interfaces.In order to develop applications one has to wait till one gets the required multi-touch screen.There is a Java based TUIO simulator but it does not help in utilizing the full capabilities of the protocol and only preliminary applications can be developed using it.</p>

<p>This project aims at a new Qt based fast and full featured simulator for Multi-Touch applications.The functionalities implemented are :</p>

<ol>
<li><p>User will be able to add customizable polygons to the table and thus the application could be developed for all sort of items.</p></li>
<li><p>The items will be able to rotate and translate independently and concurrently too.</p></li>
</ol><p>3.The user will be able to set a path for the items to follow during the animation run and hence he/she will be relieved of moving the items again and again by the mouse. The points on the path is given by clicking which are interpolated using Bezier curves.</p>

<p>4.The items created can be saved individually or in groups as a session in an XML file which can be reloaded on a future run so that the same gestures could be repeated again.</p>

<p>5.The simulator is now able to transmit TUIO data for multiple instances of both cursor and object - for created as well as uploaded items .</p>

<p>6.On the animation timeline , the objects can now be set to animate during a normalized time period, so that changing the timeline affects the period of animation equally to all.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Multiple customizable TUIO sender can be set.</p></li>
<li><p>Two-finger emulation with right click supported. This is a most wanted feature from the Apple Simulator and can be used to simulate pinching and zooming !!</p></li>
<li><p>Opacity control helps you make the simulator transparent and keep it above the application, thus giving an impression of touching the application itself.</p></li>
<li><p>Resize Table to fit your multi touch application.</p></li>
</ol><p>SIMTOUCH : SimTouch is another TUIO simulator build using the Adobe Air runtime. The core benefit to using SimTouch is the transparent background allowing the application developer to have a better grasp of what he/she is 'touching' <a href="http://code.google.com/p/simtouch/">http://code.google.com/p/simtouch/</a></p>
